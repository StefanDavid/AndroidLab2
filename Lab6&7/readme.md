Lab6
I followed the instructions and everything went smoothly
Never used Shared preferences before(or do not remember using them), but nice to see hoe they work.
The rest I have used many times, but I did struggle because one ofe my typos(I looked over the code for 40 minutes without noticing the error).

Lab7
I followed the instructions and everything went almost smoothly
I do not understand why it does not require any mic permissions. It is the firs time I am seeing something like that.
I was quite amazed to see that work right away.
I think I will play with this function in the future to see exactly how it is working

I have never used the fragments before and it was nice to see how they work. Altough I thing I got something working weirdly, 
I am not sure how they were supposed to look like(the tutorial was a little bit old).


P.S. I could not record the ex7.1 it was blocking my mic.
